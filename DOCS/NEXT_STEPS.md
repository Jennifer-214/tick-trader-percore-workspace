# Next Steps

**This file used to be the canonical roadmap (v3.x era). It's now a
navigation index — the actual roadmap moved to per-sprint planning
docs.**

## Where to look

| For | See |
|---|---|
| Current sprint roadmap | operator-private working notes (gitignored; not on the public repo) |
| What just shipped | `DOCS/CHANGELOG.md` — v5.9.5h–j Sprint A close + v5.10.0/0a Sprint B in progress |
| Known limitations + workarounds | `DOCS/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` |
| Architectural invariants per area | `DOCS/CLAUDE_INVARIANTS.md`, `DOCS/CLAUDE_ML_INVARIANTS.md` |
| Hot path perf changelog | `DOCS/HOT_PATH_CHANGELOG.md` |
| Deferred items / next major | operator-private working notes (gitignored) |

# tools/check_determinism_selftest.sh — .E.0.1 NEGATIVE self-test: "does the net catch its regression?"
#
# THE NET THAT GUARDS THE NET. check_determinism.sh proves the tree is clean (GREEN); THIS proves the
# gates have TEETH — each one goes RED when its specific regression is injected. It is the structural
# close of the .E.0.1 §3 lesson: a CI gate verified only by GREEN-on-clean is NOT verified (the dead
# pre-commit hook ran clean for an unknown span because nobody had watched it FAIL on a real trigger).
# Discipline: a standing gate ships with a negative self-test that injects its target regression and
# asserts it's caught — incl. through the REAL trigger, not just direct invocation.
#
# Run on demand, from /post-ship-audit (standing pre-close step), or in CI. Every injection is sandboxed
# and SELF-REVERTING; a trap restores the tree on ANY exit. Run on a clean working tree.
#
# Coverage: (1) FP-golden corruption -> FP gate RED · (2) stray global setlocale -> locale gate RED ·
# (4) the REAL trigger: core.hooksPath still points at the canonical tracked hook AND that hook BLOCKS a
# staged determinism drift. (F-076 padding determinism is guarded at COMPILE time — a runtime
# characterization of "padding is deterministically zero" is fundamentally fragile, see codify notes —
# so it is not a runtime case here.)

# Target / Label Interface

**Read this when adding a new ML target.** The contract reuses the
existing `label_table[]` registry in `Backtest/LabelFunctions.hpp`
— that file's comment says it best: "adding a new label type = 1
function + 1 table entry."

---

## Existing registry (already X-macro-shaped)

`Backtest/LabelFunctions.hpp` defines:

```cpp
#define LABEL_WIN_LOSS           0
#define LABEL_BARRIER            1
#define LABEL_FORWARD_PNL        2
#define LABEL_REGIME             3
#define LABEL_VOL_BARRIER        4
#define LABEL_WILL_PEAK          5
#define LABEL_WILL_VALLEY        6
#define LABEL_PEAK_VALLEY_STABLE 7

static const LabelTableEntry label_table[] = {
    { LABEL_WIN_LOSS,    "win_loss",     "Win/Loss",     /* fn ptr */, ... },
    { LABEL_BARRIER,     "barrier",      "Barrier",      ... },
    /* etc */
};
```

This is essentially the `FOREACH_TARGET(X)` registry; v5.8/v5.9 don't
need to introduce a new pattern.

## Canonical signature

```cpp
inline float Label_<Name>(
    const HistoricalTick* ticks,
    int n_ticks,
    int idx,
    /* label-specific params: tp_pct, sl_pct, horizon, etc. */);
```

Returns `float` value. Interpretation by `label_kind`:
- 0 = binary (0.0 or 1.0)
- 1 = regression (any float)
- ≥2 = multiclass (integer cast as float, 0..N-1)

`HistoricalTick` is defined in `LabelFunctions.hpp:25`. Labels look
forward in tick history, so they MUST be computed in a backtest
post-processing pass after the full sample set exists.

## Recipe — adding a new target

```
1. Add label compute function to Backtest/LabelFunctions.hpp:

   inline float Label_MyTarget(
       const HistoricalTick* ticks, int n, int idx,
       float horizon_ticks /* params */)
   {
       /* scan forward from idx, compute value */
       return /* float */;
   }

2. Add #define LABEL_MY_TARGET = next_id at the top of the file:

   #define LABEL_MY_TARGET 8  // (if 7 is the current highest)

3. Append entry to label_table[]:

   { LABEL_MY_TARGET, "my_target", "My Target", Label_MyTarget,
     /* label_kind: 0=binary, 1=regression, 2+=multiclass */,
     /* default params */ }

4. Run: ./build.sh test

5. Train per-target via Backtest_RunFullValidation(..., LABEL_MY_TARGET).
   Stamp records target_kind. CoreModelZoo loads to its slot.

DONE. 2 sites total: function + table entry.
```

## Multi-target deployment (post-v5.9.2e)

When v5.9.2e ships target ranking + multi-target training:

- Each target gets its own stamped model
- Path convention: `models/<label_name>/model.bin` + matching `.stamp`
  (where `<label_name>` is `label_table[i].name`)
- Stamp body's `target_kind` field carries the LABEL_* constant
- `verify_model_stamp` rejects load if `target_kind` doesn't match
  the caller's expected kind
- `CoreModelZoo` loads multiple target-specific models per core (one
  per role: barrier, regime, exit, buy_signal — extend with target-
  specific roles)
- Strategy at inference picks ranked-best target's model OR blends

## label_kind semantics

`label_kind` dictates training objective + metric interpretation:

| Kind | Training objective | Metric (in WalkForwardFoldResult) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 binary | `binary:logistic` | accuracy, AUC |
| 1 regression | `reg:squarederror` | MSE, Pearson correlation |
| 2+ multiclass | `multi:softprob` (num_class = label_kind) | multiclass accuracy |

Existing helpers:
- `XGBoost_ComputeScalePosWeight` — class-imbalance for binary
- `XGBoost_ComputeMulticlassWeights` — class-imbalance for multiclass
- `WalkForward_ComputeAccuracy` / `_ComputeMSE` / `_ComputeCorrelation` /
  `_ComputeMulticlassAccuracy` — metric computation per kind

## What NOT to do

- **Don't compute labels at training time using look-ahead data** that
  wouldn't be available in production. Labels look forward in TIME
  but only into data that already existed at sample-construction
  time — never into future samples.
- **Don't bypass `label_table`** by hardcoding label kind in your
  training script. Consumers (BacktestEngine, ModelInference, GUI
  display) all dispatch by `label_table[i]` — going around it =
  drift.
- **Don't add a target whose label kind doesn't fit 0/1/≥2.** If you
  need a different shape (multi-output regression, structured output,
  etc.), extend the existing kind enum + update all the metric
  helpers. Don't shoehorn into "regression" with magic post-
  processing.

## Snapshot-test discipline (v5.9.2a+)

Labels currently have NO `LABEL_REGISTRY_HASH` (the `label_table[]` is
hand-maintained, not X-macro-generated). The v5.9.2a snapshot tests
in `tests/controller_test.cpp` (search for "Sub-area 3") are the SOLE
protection against label body changes — a future `FOREACH_TARGET`
X-macro retrofit (deferred to v5.10+) would add structural protection.

Each of the 8 label functions has a fixed-input snapshot test. The
synthetic input is a 200-tick array with deterministic ramp/dip
shape; expected outputs match each label's documented contract.

**When you modify a Label function body:**

1. Run `./build.sh test`. If the v5.9.2a label snapshot block fails,
   your change has observable effect.
2. Decide:
   - **Bytewise-equivalent refactor**: preserve outputs, no test
     update.
   - **Intentional semantic shift** (changing lookahead semantics,
     fixing a bug): update the recorded snapshot values. CHANGELOG:
     "v5.X.Y changed Label_<NAME> semantics; models trained on old
     labels are not comparable to new training runs."
3. Until `FOREACH_TARGET` exists, there's no automatic refuse-to-load
   mechanism — operator discipline + snapshot test + CHANGELOG is
   the protection layer.

**Less urgent than feature snapshot drift** because labels are
TRAINING-time only (live engine never sees labels). Drift is a
research-integrity concern (you can't compare two backtests if labels
changed semantics) rather than runtime-prediction concern.

See `DOCS/CLAUDE_ML_INVARIANTS.md` "Feature output snapshot is part
of the parity surface" for the analogous discipline applied to
features (which IS runtime-critical).

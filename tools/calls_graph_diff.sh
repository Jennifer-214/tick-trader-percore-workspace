#!/bin/bash
# tools/calls_graph_diff.sh — find functions called only in legacy entrypoint
# but not in any sharded entrypoint. Catches orphaned-after-architectural-
# migration patterns like the v4.x sharded port that silently dropped
# Strategy_Adapt / _BuySignal / _ExitAdjust calls (root cause of v5.4
# postmortem F7-F10).
#
# Usage:
#   ./tools/calls_graph_diff.sh
#
# Exits 0 with empty output = clean (no orphans). Non-empty output =
# functions to review (likely orphaned, possibly intentionally skipped).
#
# This is the tool the readiness skill (Phase 6.1) will require for any
# plan that touches strategy code or per-core architecture.

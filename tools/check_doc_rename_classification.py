tools/check_doc_rename_classification.py — Pre-classification tool for .D.1 doc-sweep ship.

Detects per-core → per-node terminology drift candidates in .md files across DOCS/ + DESIGN_SPECS/
+ plans/ scope. Classifies each hit per 12-class matrix; emits TSV for operator triage.

Sister to:
  tools/check_plan_body_symbol_existence.py (B-Plus pattern)
  tools/check_forward_promise_audit.py (Check 11 .D ship pattern)

M7 8th canonical structural enforcement application per
DESIGN_SPECS/meta-disciplines/structural-enforcement-when-memory-insufficient.md.

Per .D.1 plan body Phase A.1 + cycle 1+2+3 audit amendments.

=== CLASSIFICATION → ACTION MAPPING (read before triaging TSV) ===

The tool is a FIRST-PASS classifier; the TSV is operator-reviewed at Phase A.4 +
per-phase. It biases toward LEAVE on the keep/historical/transition classes and
RENAME on narrative. Confusion-prevention: the narrative-* classes ALL map to the
SAME action (RENAME). The aspirational-vs-current-state distinction is rationale-
tagging for the audit trail only — there is NO action difference between them. Do
not look for a different edit behavior between narrative-aspirational and
narrative-current-state; both mean "rename per-core -> per-node here."

  LEAVE                       : keep-token-context, archived-file,
                                current-changelog-row, transition-documentation,
                                code-fence-cite, ship-tag-citation, historical-tense
  RENAME                      : narrative-aspirational, narrative-current-state
  RENAME-WITH-CONFIRM         : code-fence-target
  SISTER-RENAME-CANDIDATE     : memory-link-crossref
  SISTER-COHORT-XREF          : claude-md-section-crossref

=== KNOWN LIMITATIONS (manual-verify surfaces; per .D.1 R3 over-rename risk) ===

1. SECTION-HEADER CONTEXT NOT TRACKED. Classification is per-LINE. A line inside a
   historical/worked-example section ("## Historical context (v5.10)") that lacks a
   per-line past-tense verb is classified narrative-current-state -> RENAME even
   though the whole section is historical and should be LEFT. MITIGATION: at TSV
   triage, manually verify RENAME hits that fall under headers containing
   "Historical" / "Worked example" / "Changelog" / a vN.M ship tag. The comprehensive
   `rg` pass at plan body Phase H.2 + operator review at Phase A.4 are the safety nets.
   This is a DELIBERATE non-feature: a section-context state machine was rejected as
   gold-plating (feedback_framework_layer_payoff_diminishing_returns) since both
   review checkpoints already catch the bounded over-rename risk.

2. TRANSITIVE SEMANTIC DRIFT NOT CAUGHT. Lines that REFER to per-core framing without
   using a target token ("see CLAUDE.md's sharding model") are invisible to token
   matching. MITIGATION: plan body Phase H.4.1 semantic-context spot-check.

3. DEFAULT BIAS IS RENAME ON NARRATIVE. Under-rename (missed sites) is caught by the
   comprehensive rg pass; over-rename (false positive) is caught by operator TSV review.
   Both directions have a review safety net by design.

#
# CODE SYMBOLS (CoreContext / MAX_CORES / state.cores / FOREACH_PER_CORE_CFG_FIELD /

# IDENTIFIERS still named Core*/per_core until v5.15.5.F.4d.1.E.1 — they rename WITH the
# code at .E.1 (doc-citations + code together as a sister-cohort), NOT at this doc sweep.
# Reasons (per .D.1 Phase A proof finding 2026-05-28):
#   1. Renaming `CoreContext`→`NodeContext` in prose NOW cites a symbol that won't exist in
#      code until .E.1 (Class-14-flavored fabricated-symbol-in-docs).
#   2. Produces half-renamed phrases ("cores[16] × NodeContext" — array still `cores`, type
#      now `NodeContext`).
#   3. Underscore/identifier tokens (per_core, MAX_CORES) match INSIDE larger identifiers
#      (FOREACH_PER_CORE_CFG_FIELD, per_core_slow) → substring mangling
#      (sister: feedback_avoid_substring_replace_all_on_member_access + Class 36).
